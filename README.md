#### Asana for Android

This is an unofficial Android app for asana.com,
utilizing the wonderful [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com) by
Jake Wharton.  Because the project is so early in its life-cycle, there isn't
much else to say here.

Until there is something interesting to report, please enjoy this small cow
