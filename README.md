#### Asana for Android

This is an unofficial Android app for asana.com,
utilizing the wornderful [ActionBarSherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com) by
Jake Wharton.  Because the project is so early in its life-cycle, there isn't
much else to say here.

Until there is something interesting to report, please enjoy this small cow

#### Branch Purpose

The Purpose of the ContentProvider branch is to reimplement the database as a
ContentProvider, thus removing the requirement to use deprecated direct
database deletes.  It also prevents direct queries and insertions, but I can't
pass up a good consonance.
